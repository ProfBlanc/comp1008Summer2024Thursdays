When you want to validate values => set the Access Level as private


AcessLevel

public: access to entity anywhere

protected, default: access to entity in same package

private: access to entity only in class



Getter/Setter
    special method that allows user to have indirect access to private instance variable
        Why? Restrict values => validation
        1: Getter: retrieve value
        2: Setter: enforce limitations


Instance Variable: variable declared outside a method, inside a class
                    Accessible throughout every method

                    attribute/characteristic
